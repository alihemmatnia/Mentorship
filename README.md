In many educational and consulting systems, finding expert mentors and coordinating suitable times for sessions is a significant challenge. These issues limit learners' access to valuable resources and make it difficult for mentors to connect regularly and effectively with their mentees.  

This system involves two primary roles: mentor and mentee.  

A mentor is someone with sufficient expertise and experience in a specific field, ready to share their knowledge and insights with others. After registering and being approved by platform experts, mentors can introduce themselves to users by uploading introduction videos or teaching samples. They can also specify their available consultation times in a calendar and define the cost and type of each session (text-based or voice calls).  

On the other hand, a mentee is an individual seeking advice or learning from mentors. After registering on the platform, the mentee can search for their desired mentor using available filters. The mentor's profile includes specialties, a brief work history, introduction videos, teaching samples, and ratings and reviews from other users. Mentees can reserve a session by selecting a suitable time and paying the required fee, then join the consultation session via chat or voice call at the scheduled time.  

The platform also allows mentees to provide feedback after a session, enabling them to rate mentors and report any issues if needed. Mentors, in turn, can view their earnings from sessions and submit withdrawal requests through their wallet panel.  

The main roles in this scenario are:  
- **Mentor:** Provides consultations and training.  
- **Mentee:** Receives consultations and training.  
- **Platform expert:** Reviews and approves mentorsâ€™ information and videos, and addresses reports.  

This platform facilitates the process of connecting mentors and mentees by offering features like search functionality, time reservation, and online payment, streamlining educational and consulting services.
